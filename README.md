# FloorballCounter

Design and implement an app to track scores between two teams playing a game.

To complete this project, you will need to build a Score Keeper app. You can either start from scratch, or customize the Court Counter app you made as part of Practice set 2.

In either case, you will need to select a sport or game to track. Importantly, you'll need to select a sport with either multiple ways to score points or multiple metrics to track. If you have trouble choosing, here are some suggestions:

Baseball Scores App: Track both runs and outs
American Football Scores App: Add a button for each of the 4 amounts of points a team can score in american football.
Football Scores app: Track both points and fouls
